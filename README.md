# sunrisesunset

This repository contains a small independent project, which uses the google maps API and the sunrise-sunset api (https://sunrise-sunset.org/api)
in order to create a map that locates the user, indicates their sunrise and sunset times, and also indicate the sunrise and sunset times of 
several other cities and locations across the world. 

Currently the times of sunrise and sunset are not adjusted for time zones.
